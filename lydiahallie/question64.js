/**
 * With the import keyword, all imported modules are pre-parsed. 
 * This means that the imported modules get run first, the code in the file which imports the 
 * module gets executed after.
 * This is a difference between require() in CommonJS and import! With require(), 
 * you can load dependencies on demand while the code is being run. If we would have used require 
 * instead of import, running index.js, running sum.js, 3 would have been logged to the console.
