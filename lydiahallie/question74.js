/*
Yes, It is a pure function

A pure function is a function that always returns the same result, if the same arguments are passed.

The sum function always returns the same result. If we pass 1 and 2, it will always return 3 without side effects. If we pass 5 and 10, it will always return 15, and so on. This is the definition of a pure function.
